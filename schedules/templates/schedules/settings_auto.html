				Automation Preferences:<br>
				- These settings affect how the system will schedule shifts during automation.<br>
				- There are three settings on this page:<br><br>
				1: Automatically Schedule Shifts<br>
				- When the box is checked, the system will automatically schedule certain shifts for you.<br>
				- This includes shifts that only the exact number of workers needed can cover (i.e. 5 workers needed & 5 workers availible)<br>
				- This also includes scheduling staphers that are the best option in the most parameters as long as the threshold is met (i.e. the worker is the best option in 3 parameters and the threshold is 3)<br>
				- When the box is not checked, the system will not automatically schedule shifts.<br>
				- Automatically Schedule Shifts is reccomended.<br>
				<br><br>
				2: Threshold to Automatically Schedule Shifts<br>
				- The threshold (represented by the box w/ a number in it) only matters when Automatically Scheduling Shift is on<br>
				- It will affect whether or not the system automatically schedules a stapher or give you suggestions and lets you decide<br>
				- Close to %50 of the parameter count is the reccomended threshold. (If 6 parameters chosen, threshold = 3)<br>
				- If you want the system to automatically place as many shifts as possible chose 0.<br>
				<br><br>
				3: Tie Breaking<br>
				- This settings decides how a shift is scheduled given 2 or more workers are the "best option" given the parameters<br>
				- i.e. If Calvin and Nate are both the best option in 3 parameters, how would you like the system to handle that.<br>
				- If two workers tie in the same parameter they are both considered the best option.<br>
				- This settings only matters if the "Automatically Scheduling Shifts" box is checked.<br>
				- Also manually breaking ties ("I want to always choose") is reccomended<br>
